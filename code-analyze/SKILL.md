# Code Analyze

## Code checklist

1. Code organization and structure
2. Relations of implementations (about types, interfaces)
3. Relations of implementations (about functions)
4. Specific contexts and usages
5. Pitfalls
6. Improvement points 1 (about design overview)
7. Improvement points 2 (about types, interfaces)
8. Improvement points 3 (about implementaions)
9. Learning paths on implementations (entries and goals)

## Instructions

1. Read the target files using Read tool
2. Search for patterns using Grep
3. Find related files using Glob
4. Provide detailed feedback on code quality and design
